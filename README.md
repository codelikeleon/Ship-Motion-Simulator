# Ship-Motion-Simulator
My 3rd year Computer Science dissertation at the University of Exeter

* Implements Shallow Water Equations (Navier-Strokes Equations) to provide a water simulation, as well as a simpler height-field fluid function water sim.
* A 3D visualisation is rendered in real-time with OpenGL
* Interact with the water by creating waves and droplets with 'SPACEBAR', 'E'.
* FPS style camera controls
* Can load textures and 3D models in wavefront (.obj) format by placing them in the /obj folder and adding the filename to the code

Future work:
* Water-Ship interaction
* Code/file directory cleanups
* GUI
* Enhanced interactivity
